= tjur
A new Language

== What's with the name?
Because, it comes from Clojure, it is Typed, and it has four letters!

== Goals

1. Strictly typed, inferred, optionally dynamically typed.
2. Compiled, with optional jit.
3. Flexible memory management: (Manual, rust style ownership tracking, reference counted, garbage collected)
4. Interoperability with C++
5. Flexible module system. (ES6 and go inspired. Bundler and Homebrew style dependency resolution)
6. Node style async API. Agent based multithreading. (Everything is Agent local. CSP style communication)
